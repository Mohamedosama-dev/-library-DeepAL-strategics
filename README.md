In this project i run three different strategies 
(uncertainty sampling, margin sampling, entropy sampling) in three 
dataset, first data is cifr 10, second data is mnist ,and third data is 
unbalanced shvn and calculate training accuracy, test accuracy after 
each iteration and plot every strategy and make Compression 
between them and register them un this report and we make model 
nlp and run three different strategies on it and make Compression
between,strategies
